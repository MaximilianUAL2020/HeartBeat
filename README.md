# HeartBeat

Do you neglect physical activity while working on your computer?

HeartBeat is a chrome extension that reminds you to take small breaks throughout seated working periods and encourages users to balance their digital intake with physical activity. Set a preferred timer and keep track of your lifespan by looking at the health bar. Once the timer has run out, HeartBeat will prompt you to take a small break - go stretch, make a cup of tea, or take out the trash while your health bar recharges.
